/** 
 * Signature for functions passed as steps to [DialogAction.waterfall()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.dialogaction.html#waterfall). 
 * 
 * Waterfalls let you prompt a user for information using a sequence of questions. Each step of the
 * waterfall can either execute one of the built-in [Prompts](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.__global.iprompts.html),
 * start a new dialog by calling [session.beginDialog()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#begindialog),
 * advance to the next step of the waterfall manually using `skip()`, or terminate the waterfall.
 * 
 * When either a dialog or built-in prompt is called from a waterfall step, the results from that 
 * dialog or prompt will be passed via the `results` parameter to the next step of the waterfall. 
 * Users can say things like "never mind" to cancel the built-in prompts so you should guard against
 * that by at least checking for [results.response](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.idialogresult.html#response) 
 * before proceeding. A more detailed explanation of why the waterfall is being continued can be 
 * determined by looking at the [code](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/enums/_botbuilder_d_.resumereason.html) 
 * returned for [results.resumed](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.idialogresult.html#resumed).
 * 
 * You can manually advance to the next step of the waterfall using the `skip()` function passed
 * in. Calling `skip({ response: "some text" })` with an [IDialogResult](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.idialogresult.html)
 * lets you more accurately mimic the results from a built-in prompt and can simplify your overall
 * waterfall logic.
 * 
 * You can terminate a waterfall early by either falling through every step of the waterfall using
 * calls to `skip()` or simply not starting another prompt or dialog.
 * 
 * __note:__ Waterfalls have a hidden last step which will automatically end the current dialog if 
 * if you call a prompt or dialog from the last step. This is useful where you have a deep stack of
 * dialogs and want a call to [session.endDialog()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#enddialog)
 * from the last child on the stack to end the entire stack. The close of the last child will trigger
 * all of its parents to move to this hidden step which will cascade the close all the way up the stack.
 * This is typically a desired behavior but if you want to avoid it or stop it somewhere in the 
 * middle you'll need to add a step to the end of your waterfall that either does nothing or calls 
 * something like [session.send()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#send)
 * which isn't going to advance the waterfall forward.   
 * @example
 * <pre><code>
 * var bot = new builder.BotConnectorBot();
 * bot.add('/', [
 *     function (session) {
 *         builder.Prompts.text(session, "Hi! What's your name?");
 *     },
 *     function (session, results) {
 *         if (results && results.response) {
 *             // User answered question.
 *             session.send("Hello %s.", results.response);
 *         } else {
 *             // User said never mind.
 *             session.send("OK. Goodbye.");
 *         }
 *     }
 * ]);
 * </code></pre>

 * the development of complex bots. The [UniversalBot](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.universalbot.html)
 * class is itself a Library that forms the root of this chain. 
 * 
 * Libraries of reusable parts can be developed by creating a new Library instance and adding dialogs 
 * just as you would to a bot. Your library should have a unique name that corresponds to either your 
 * libraries website or NPM module name.  Bots can then reuse your library by simply adding your parts
 * Library instance to their bot using [UniversalBot.library()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.universalbot.html#library).
 * If your library itself depends on other libraries you should add them to your library as a dependency 
 * using [Library.library()](#library). You can easily manage multiple versions of your library by 
 * adding a version number to your library name.
 * 
 * To invoke dialogs within your library bots will need to call [session.beginDialog()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#begindialog)
 * with a fully qualified dialog id in the form of '<libName>:<dialogId>'. You'll typically hide 
 * this from the developer by exposing a function from their module that starts the dialog for them.
 * So calling something like `myLib.someDialog(session, { arg: '' });` would end up calling
 * `session.beginDialog('myLib:someDialog', args);` under the covers.
 * 
 * It's worth noting that dialogs are always invoked within the current dialog so once your within
 * a dialog from your library you don't need to prefix every beginDialog() call your with your 
 * libraries name. It's only when crossing from one library context to another that you need to 
 * include the library name prefix.

    /**
     * Registers an event listener. The bot will emit its own events as it processes incoming and outgoing messages. It will also forward activity related events emitted from the connector, giving you one place to listen for all activity from your bot. The flow of events from the bot is as follows:
     * 
     * #### Message Received
     * When the bot receives a new message it will emit the following events in order: 
     * 
     * > lookupUser -> receive -> incoming -> getStorageData -> routing
     * 
     * Any [receive middleware](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.imiddlewaremap#receive) that's been installed will be executed between the 'receive' and 'incoming' events. After the 'routing' event is emitted any 
     * [botbuilder middleware](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.imiddlewaremap#botbuilder) will be executed prior to dispatching the message to the bots active dialog.  
     * 
     * #### Connector Activity Received
     * Connectors can emit activity events to signal things like a user is typing or that they friended a bot. These activities get routed through middleware like messages but they are not routed through the bots dialog system.  They are only ever emitted as events.
     * 
     * The flow of connector events is: 
     * 
     * > lookupUser -> receive -> (activity)
     * 
     * #### Message sent
     * Bots can send multiple messages so the session will batch up all outgoing message and then save the bots current state before delivering the sent messages.  You'll see a single 'saveStorageData' event emitted and then for every outgoing message in the batch you'll see the following
     * sequence of events: 
     * 
     * > send -> outgoing
     * 
     * Any [send middleware](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.imiddlewaremap#send) that's been installed will be executed between the 'send' and 'outgoing' events. 
     *  
     * @param event Name of the event. Bot and connector specific event types:
     * #### Bot Events
     * - __error:__ An error occured. Passed a JavaScript `Error` object.
     * - __lookupUser:__ The user is for an address is about to be looked up. Passed an [IAddress](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.iaddress.html) object.
     * - __receive:__ An incoming message has been received. Passed an [IEvent](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.ievent.html) object.
     * - __incoming:__ An incoming message has been received and processed by middleware. Passed an [IMessage](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.imessage.html) object.
     * - __routing:__ An incoming message has been bound to a session and is about to be routed through any session middleware and then dispatched to the active dialog for processing. Passed a [Session](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html) object.
     * - __send:__ An outgoing message is about to be sent to middleware for processing. Passed an [IMessage](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.imessage.html) object.
     * - __outgoing:__ An outgoing message has just been sent through middleware and is about to be delivered to the users chat client.
     * - __getStorageData:__ The sessions persisted state data is being loaded from storage. Passed an [IBotStorageContext](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.ibotstoragecontext.html) object.
     * - __saveStorageData:__ The sessions persisted state data is being written to storage. Passed an [IBotStorageContext](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.ibotstoragecontext.html) object.
     * 
     * #### ChatConnector Events
     * - __conversationUpdate:__ Your bot was added to a conversation or other conversation metadata changed. Passed an [IConversationUpdate](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.iconversationupdate.html) object.
     * - __contactRelationUpdate:__ The bot was added to or removed from a user's contact list. Passed an [IContactRelationUpdate](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.icontactrelationupdate.html) object.
     * - __typing:__ The user or bot on the other end of the conversation is typing. Passed an [IEvent](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.ievent.html) object.
