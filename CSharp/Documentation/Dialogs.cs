    /// \section Overview
    /// %Dialogs model a conversational process, where the exchange of messages between bot and user
    /// is the primary channel for interaction with the outside world. Each dialog is an abstraction that encapsulates
    /// its own state in a C# class that implements IDialog.  %Dialogs can be composed with other dialogs to maximize reuse,
    /// and a dialog context maintains a stack of dialogs active in the conversation. A conversation composed of dialogs is
    /// portable across machines to make it possible to scale a bot implementation. This conversation state (the stack of
    /// active dialogs and each dialog's state) is stored in the state service provided by the %Bot Connector service, making the bot
    /// implementation stateless between requests. (Much like a web application that does not store session state in the
    /// web server's memory.)
    /// 
    /// The best way to understand this is to work through some examples. The first example changes the code in the 
    /// %Bot Framework template to use dialogs from the %Bot %Builder. The second example, \ref echoBot builds on that to
    /// add some simple state. The final example \ref alarmBot uses the [LUIS] natural language framework and some of the 
    /// built-in system prompts.
    /// 
    /// \section simpleEcho Echo Bot
    /// This example starts with the bot you get by starting your bot the %Bot Framework template which includes code to 
    /// echo back what the user says.  
    /// In order to change the echo example to use the %Bot %Builder, we first need to import the required namespace:
    /// ~~~
    /// using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs;
    /// ~~~
    /// 
    /// Next we need to add a C# class to represent our conversation. 
    /// You can do this by adding this class to your MessagesController.cs file:
    /// \dontinclude SimpleEchoBot/Controllers/MessagesController.cs
    /// \skip Serializable
    /// \until }
    /// \until }
    /// \until }
    /// 
    /// Finally we need to wire the class into your Post method like this:
    /// \dontinclude SimpleEchoBot/Controllers/MessagesController.cs
    /// \skip Post(
    /// \until HandleSystemMessage
    /// \until }
    /// \until }
    /// 
    /// The method is marked async because the %Bot %Builder makes use of the C# facilities for handling asynchronous communication. 
    /// It returns a Task which is representing the task responsible for sending replies for the passed in Message.  
    /// If there is an exception, the Task will contain the exception information. Within the Post method we call
    /// Conversation.SendAsync which is the root method for the %Bot %Builder SDK. It follows the dependency
    /// inversion principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) and does the following steps:
    /// - Instantiate the required components.  
    /// - Deserialize the dialog state (the dialog stack and each dialog's state) from IBotDataStore (the default implementation uses the %Bot Connector state API as backing IBotDataStore).
    /// - Resume the conversation processes where the %Bot decided to suspend and wait for a message.
    /// - Send the replies.
    /// - Serialize the updated dialog state and persist it back to IBotDataStore.
    /// 
    /// When your conversation first starts, there is no dialog state in the IBotDataStore so the delegate passed to Conversation.SendAsync
    /// will be used to construct an EchoDialog and it's StartAsync method will be called. In this case, StartAsync  calls
    /// IDialogContext.Wait with the continuation delegate (our MessageReceivedAsync method) to call when there is a new message.  
    /// In the initial case there is an immediate message available (the one that launched the dialog) and it is immediately 
    /// passed To MessageReceivedAsync.  
    /// 
    /// Within MessageReceivedAsync we wait for the message to come in and then post our response and wait for the next message. 
    /// In this simple case the next message would again be processed by MessageReceivedAsync. 
    /// Every time we call IDialogContext.Wait our bot is suspended and can be restarted on any machine that receives the message.  
    /// 
    /// If you run and test this bot, it will behave exactly like the original one from the %Bot Framework template. It is a
    /// little more complicated, but it allows you to compose together multiple dialogs into complex conversations without
    /// having to explicitly manage state.   
    /// 
    /// \section echoBot Echo Bot with State
    /// Now that we have an example of the %Bot %Builder framework we are going to build on it to add some dialog state and 
    /// some commands to control that state. We are going to number the responses and allow the command "reset" to reset the
    /// count. All we need to do is to replace our EchoDialog with the one below. 
    /// \dontinclude EchoBot/EchoDialog.cs
    /// \skip Serializable
    /// \until AfterResetAsync(
    /// \until context.Wait
    /// \until }
    /// \until }
    /// 
    /// The first change you will notice is the addition of `protected int count = 1;`. This is the state we are persisting
    /// with this dialog on each message.  
    /// 
    /// In MessageReceivedAsync we have added check to see if the input was "reset" and if that is true we use the built-in
    /// Prompts.Confirm dialog to spawn a sub-dialog that asks the user if they are sure about resetting the count. The sub-dialog has its
    /// own private state and does not need to worry about interfering with the parent dialog. When the sub dialog
    /// is done, it's result is then passed onto the AfterResetAync method. In AfterResetAsync we check on the 
    /// response and perform the action including sending a message back to the user. The final step is to do IDialogContext.Wait 
    /// with a continuation back to MessageReceivedAsync on the next message.
    /// 
    /// \section alarmBot Alarm Bot
    /// This example is more complex and shows how to integrate [LUIS] together with PromptDialog to create an alarm 
    /// system you can interact with through natural language.  
    /// In order to create a dialog that uses [LUIS] you need to create a class that derives from
    /// LuisDialog like this:
    /// \dontinclude SimpleAlarmBot/SimpleAlarmDialog.cs
    /// \skip LuisModel
    /// \until {
    /// 
    /// The parameters to the LuisModel attribute are the [LUIS] REST endpoint and key. Here we have supplied
    /// some values that will work, but the endpoint may be throttled in which case you will need to setup your own endpoint 
    /// as described in [How to Setup LUIS].  
    /// 
    /// Within the SimpleAlarmDialog class any method with the name of the [LUIS] intent or marked with the LuisIntent attribute
    /// is called when that intent is matched. For example here is the handler for turning off an
    /// alarm, i.e. the intent "builtin.intent.alarm.turn_off_alarm":
    /// \dontinclude SimpleAlarmBot/SimpleAlarmDialog.cs
    /// \skip builtin.intent.alarm.turn_off_alarm
    /// \until context.Wait
    /// \until }
    /// \until }
    /// Within the handler you can see the confirmation done using the built-in Prompt.Confirm dialog.  
    /// The confirm dialog will spawn a sub-dialog for verifying the alarm deletion. Here is the full
    /// example:
    /// \include SimpleAlarmBot/SimpleAlarmDialog.cs
    /// 
    /// \section IDialogContext
    /// All of the dialogs take in an IDialogContext, an interface that provides the services
    /// needed to save state and communicate.  
    /// The interface is composed of three interfaces: Internals.IBotData, Internals.IDialogStack, and Internals.IBotToUser.
    ///
    /// Internals.IBotData represents access to the per user, conversation, and private conversation, aka user in conversation state, maintained
    /// by the %Bot Connector. The per user state is useful for storing things about the user that cross
    /// conversations--for example the last sandwich order so that you can use that as the default 
    /// when ordering a sandwich. It is also possible to store such state in your own store
    /// and use the Message.From.Id as a key.  
    /// 
    /// Internals.IBotToUser provides methods to post messages to be sent to the user, according to some policy. Some of these messages may be sent
    /// inline with the response to the web api method call, and some of these messages may be sent directly using the %Bot Connector client.
    /// Sending and receiving messages through the dialog context ensures the Internals.IBotData state is passed through the %Bot Connector.
    /// 
    /// Internals.IDialogStack provides methods to:
    /// - Call children dialogs and push the new child on the dialog stack.
    /// - Mark the current dialog as done and return a result to the calling dialog and pop the current dialog from the dialog stack.
    /// - Wait for a message from the user and suspend the conversation until the message arrives.
    /// The stack is usually automatically managed for you.
    /// 
    /// \section Serialization
    /// 
    /// The dialog stack and the state of all active dialog are serialized to the per-user, per-conversation IBotDataBag. This serialized blob is persisted through
    /// the Messages sent to and received from the %Bot Connector. Dialog classes must be marked with the serializable attribute so that Dialog object instances
    /// can participate in the runtime serialization. For example, all of the IDialog implementations in the builder library are marked as serializable.
    /// When custom serialization was desired, there is an ISerialization implementation and serialization constructor as well.
    /// 
    /// The Chain methods provide a fluent interface to dialogs that is usable in LINQ query syntax. The compiled form of LINQ query syntax often leverages anonymous methods.
    /// If these anonymous methods do not reference the environment of local variables, then these anonymous methods have no state and are trivially serializable. However, if
    /// the anonymous method captures any local variable in the environment, the resulting closure object (generated by the compiler) is not marked as serializable. The %Bot %Builder
    /// will detect this situation and throw a ClosureCaptureException to help diagnose the issue.
    /// 
    /// If you wish to try to leverage reflection to serialize classes that are not marked as serializable, the library has a reflection-based serialization surrogate that
    /// can be registered with Autofac as follows:
    /// ~~~
    /// var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
    /// builder.RegisterModule(new DialogModule());
    /// builder.RegisterModule(new ReflectionSurrogateModule());
    /// ~~~
    /// 
    /// \section Fluent Dialog Chains
    /// 
    /// Explicit management of the stack of active dialogs is possible through IDialogStack.Call<R> and IDialogStack.Done<R>, explicitly composing dialogs into a larger
    /// conversation. It is also possible to implicitly manage the stack of active dialogs through the fluent Chain methods.
    ///
    /// Here is an overview of the chain methods, followed by some examples.
    /// 
    /// Name                        | Type    | Notes
    /// -----                       | ----    | -----
    /// Chain.Select<T, R>          | LINQ    | Supports "select" and "let" in LINQ query syntax.
    /// Chain.SelectMany<T, C, R>   | LINQ    | Supports successive "from" in LINQ query syntax.
    /// Chain.Where<T>              | LINQ    | Supports "where" in LINQ query syntax.
    /// Chain.From<T>               | Chains  | Instantiates a new instance of a dialog.
    /// Chain.Return<T>             | Chains  | Return a constant value into the chain.
    /// Chain.Do<T>                 | Chains  | Allow for side-effects within the chain.
    /// Chain.ContinueWith<T, R>    | Chains  | Simple chaining of dialogs.
    /// Chain.Unwrap<T>             | Chains  | Unwrap a dialog nested in a dialog.
    /// Chain.DefaultIfException<T> | Chains  | Swallow exception from previous result and return default(T).
    /// Chain.Loop<T>               | Branch  | Loop the entire chain of dialogs.
    /// Chain.Fold<T>               | Branch  | Fold results from an enumeration of dialogs into a single result.
    /// Chain.Switch<T, R>          | Branch  | Support branching into different dialog chains.
    /// Chain.PostToUser<T>         | Message | Post a message to the user.
    /// Chain.WaitToBot<T>          | Message | Wait for a message to the bot.
    /// Chain.PostToChain<T>        | Message | Start a chain with a message from the user.
    /// 
    /// These Chain methods fall into a few buckets.
    /// 
    /// LINQ query syntax starts off with the basic Chain.Select<T, R>:
    /// 
    /// \dontinclude Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Tests\ChainTests.cs
    /// \skip MakeSelectQuery
    /// \skip query
    /// \until select
    /// 
    /// and LINQ query syntax is enhanced with support for Chain.SelectMany<T, C, R>:
    /// 
    /// \dontinclude Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Tests\ChainTests.cs
    /// \skip LinqQuerySyntax_Without_Reflection_Surrogate
    /// \skip query
    /// \until select
    /// 
    /// Posting messages from the bot to the user and vice versa are supported by a Chain.PostToUser<T> and Chain.WaitToBot<T>:
    /// 
    /// \dontinclude Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Tests\ChainTests.cs
    /// \skip PostToUser
    /// \until PostToUser
    /// 
    /// Branching conversation dialog flow is supported by Chain.Switch<T, R>:
    /// 
    /// \dontinclude Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Tests\ChainTests.cs
    /// \skip logic
    /// \until );
    /// 
    /// If Chain.Switch<T, R> returns a nested IDialog<IDialog<T>>, then the inner IDialog<T> can be unwrapped with Chain.Unwrap<T>. This allows for branching
    /// in conversations to different paths of chained dialogs, possibly of unequal length. Here is a more complete example of branching dialogs written
    /// in the fluent chain style with implicit stack management:
    /// 
    /// \dontinclude Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Tests\ChainTests.cs
    /// \skip joke
    /// \until Loop
    /// 
    /// \section Conclusion
    /// Through this description we have seen how you can easily create stateless bots that can reuse dialog building blocks
    /// ranging from simple prompts to advanced natural language. As a next step, you should explore \ref forms which 
    /// describes how the %Bot %Builder framework can automatically build dialogs from a C# class you want the user to fill in.
