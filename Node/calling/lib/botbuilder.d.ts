/** 
 * Signature for functions passed as steps to [DialogAction.waterfall()](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.dialogaction.html#waterfall). 
 * 
 * Waterfalls let you prompt a user for information using a sequence of questions. Each step of the
 * waterfall can either execute one of the built-in [Prompts](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.prompts.html),
 * start a new dialog by calling [session.beginDialog()](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#begindialog),
 * advance to the next step of the waterfall manually using `skip()`, or terminate the waterfall.
 * 
 * When either a dialog or built-in prompt is called from a waterfall step, the results from that 
 * dialog or prompt will be passed via the `results` parameter to the next step of the waterfall. 
 * Users can say things like "nevermind" to cancel the built-in prompts so you should guard against
 * that by at least checking for [results.response](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.idialogresult.html#response) 
 * before proceeding. A more detailed explination of why the waterfall is being continued can be 
 * determined by looking at the [code](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/enums/_botbuilder_d_.resumereason.html) 
 * returned for [results.resumed](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.idialogresult.html#resumed).
 * 
 * You can manually advance to the next step of the waterfall using the `skip()` function passed
 * in. Calling `skip({ response: "some text" })` with an [IDialogResult](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.idialogresult.html)
 * lets you more accurately mimic the results from a built-in prompt and can simplify your overall
 * waterfall logic.
 * 
 * You can terminate a waterfall early by either falling through every step of the waterfall using
 * calls to `skip()` or simply not starting another prompt or dialog.
 * 
 * __note:__ Waterfalls have a hidden last step which will automatically end the current dialog if 
 * if you call a prompt or dialog from the last step. This is useful where you have a deep stack of
 * dialogs and want a call to [session.endDialog()](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#enddialog)
 * from the last child on the stack to end the entire stack. The close of the last child will trigger
 * all of its parents to move to this hidden step which will cascade the close all the way up the stack.
 * This is typically a desired behaviour but if you want to avoid it or stop it somewhere in the 
 * middle you'll need to add a step to the end of your waterfall that either does nothing or calls 
 * something liek [session.send()](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#send)
 * which isn't going to advance the waterfall forward.   
 * @example
 * <pre><code>
 * var bot = new builder.BotConnectorBot();
 * bot.add('/', [
 *     function (session) {
 *         builder.Prompts.text(session, "Hi! What's your name?");
 *     },
 *     function (session, results) {
 *         if (results && results.response) {
 *             // User answered question.
 *             session.send("Hello %s.", results.response);
 *         } else {
 *             // User said nevermind.
 *             session.send("OK. Goodbye.");
 *         }
 *     }
 * ]);

 * class is itself a Library that forms the root of this chain. 
 * 
 * Libraries of reusable parts can be developed by creating a new Library instance and adding dialogs 
 * just as you would to a bot. Your library should have a unique name that corresponds to either your 
 * libraries website or NPM module name.  Bots can then reuse your library by simply adding your parts
 * Library instance to their bot using [UniversalCallBot.library()](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.UniversalCallBot.html#library).
 * If your library itself depends on other libraries you should add them to your library as a dependency 
 * using [Library.library()](#library). You can easily manage multiple versions of your library by 
 * adding a version number to your library name.
 * 
 * To invoke dialogs within your library bots will need to call [session.beginDialog()](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#begindialog)
 * with a fully qualified dialog id in the form of '<libName>:<dialogId>'. You'll typically hide 
 * this from the devloper by exposing a function from their module that starts the dialog for them.
 * So calling something like `myLib.someDialog(session, { arg: '' });` would end up calling
 * `session.beginDialog('myLib:someDialog', args);` under the covers.
 * 
 * Its worth noting that dialogs are always invoked within the current dialog so once your within
 * a dialog from your library you don't need to prefix every beginDialog() call your with your 
 * libraries name. Its only when crossing from one library context to another that you need to 
 * include the library name prefix.

 *   call another prompt or dialog from your closure it will get called a second time with the 
 *   results from the prompt/dialog. You can typically test for this second case by checking for the 
 *   existant of an `args.resumed` property. It's important to avoid getting yourself into an 
 *   infinite loop which can be easy to do.
 * * Unlike a waterfall your dialog will not automatically end. It will remain the active dialog 
 *   until you call [session.endDialog()](en-us/node/builder/calling-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#enddialog).
