## Overview
Bot Builder for Node.js examples are organized into groups and designed to illustrate the techniques needed to build great bots. To use the samples clone our GitHub repository using Git.

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder.git
    cd BotBuilder/Node
    npm install
    cd core
    npm install

The node examples below can then be found under the "Node/examples" directory. 

## Hello World
These examples show a simple "Hello World" sample for each bot type supported by the framework. 

|**Example**     | **Description**                                   
| ---------------| ---------------------------------------------
|[hello-ConsoleConnector](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/Node/examples/hello-ConsoleConnector) | "Hello World" for ConsoleConnector class.      
|[hello-ChatConnector](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/Node/examples/hello-ChatConnector) | "Hello World" for ChatConnector class.  

## Basic Techniques
